## What i would like to add in the furture
In the future i would like animate the links and the flow between the pages so that each picture hovers as you hover over it with the mouse. I would also like to make all the pictures the same size so that everything doesnt look as stretched.

### Boilerplate
The boilerplate for this project was provided by Code Insitute linked above.
