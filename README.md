# my very fist website

Welcome! [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net)

## Main focus of the website
the main focus of this website was to practice setting up links to all of the wikipedia links associated to the programmes on the site.

## What i would like to add in the furture
in the future i would like animate the links and the flow between the pages so that each picture hovers as you hover over it with the mouse. I would also like to make all the pictures the same size so that everything doesnt look as stretched.
